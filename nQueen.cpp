//N-queens problem: a chess-based combinatorial problem that 
//involves placing N queens on an NxN chessboard so that no two queens can 
//attack each other with the following specifications:In the base case 
//(r=n+1), after print Q[1â€¦n] as result, also print the placement in the 
//format as the following example shows (here n=4)
//SQSS
//SSSQ
//QSSS
//SSQS
//Where character S denotes an empty square, Q denotes a square with a queen 
//placed in it. Stops after finding 4 answers to the 8 queen problem. */
